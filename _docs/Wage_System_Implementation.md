# Wage System Implementation Guide

## üìã Overview

The Business Dashboard has been successfully updated from a monthly salary system to a comprehensive daily wage calculation system with overtime tracking and payment management capabilities.

## üîÑ Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Employee Data Structure Update

**Previous System:**
- `salary` field: Monthly salary (‚Çπ1,000 - ‚Çπ10,00,000)

**New System:**
- `daily_wage` field: Daily wage rate (‚Çπ1 - ‚Çπ50,000)
- `last_paid` field: Timestamp of last payment for wage calculation periods
- `overtime_hour` field: Hours worked beyond standard 8-hour workday

### 2. User Interface Enhancements

#### Employee Form Changes
- **Field Rename**: "Monthly Salary (‚Çπ)" ‚Üí "Daily Wage (‚Çπ)"
- **Validation Update**: Range changed from ‚Çπ1,000-‚Çπ10,00,000 to ‚Çπ1-‚Çπ50,000
- **New Field**: "Overtime Hours" field added with conditional enabling
- **Smart Logic**: Overtime field only enabled when attendance status is "Overtime"

#### Employee Table Display
- **Column Update**: "Salary" column renamed to "Daily_Wage"
- **Data Format**: Displays daily wage with currency formatting (‚ÇπX,XXX.XX)

### 3. New Wage Reports Tab

A comprehensive new tab has been added to the Reports section:

#### Features:
- **Employee Selection**: Dropdown to select any employee
- **Period Calculation**: Automatically calculates wages from last payment date to current date
- **Real-time Display**: Shows calculation breakdown with color-coded cards
- **Payment Management**: "Mark as Paid" functionality to reset calculation periods

#### Calculation Formula:
```
Total Wage = (Present Days √ó Daily Wage) + (Daily Wage √∑ 8 √ó Overtime Hours)
```

#### Display Components:
1. **Present Days Card** (Blue): Number of days worked since last payment
2. **Daily Wage Card** (Green): Employee's daily wage rate
3. **Overtime Hours Card** (Orange): Total overtime hours worked
4. **Total Wage Card** (Purple): Final calculated amount

### 4. Database Schema Migration

The system includes automatic migration to handle existing employee records:

```python
# Automatic migration in data_service.py
def _migrate_employees(self):
    """Migrate existing employee records to new wage system"""
    try:
        employees = self.db_manager.find_documents("employees")
        for employee in employees:
            update_needed = False
            updates = {}
            
            # Migrate salary to daily_wage
            if "salary" in employee and "daily_wage" not in employee:
                # Convert monthly salary to daily wage (assuming 30 working days)
                monthly_salary = employee["salary"]
                daily_wage = monthly_salary / 30
                updates["daily_wage"] = round(daily_wage, 2)
                update_needed = True
            
            # Add last_paid field if missing
            if "last_paid" not in employee:
                updates["last_paid"] = datetime.now()
                update_needed = True
            
            if update_needed:
                self.db_manager.update_document("employees", {"_id": employee["_id"]}, updates)
```

## üéØ Business Logic Implementation

### Attendance Status Integration

The system now differentiates between various attendance statuses:

- **Present**: Standard 8-hour workday
- **Overtime**: Enables overtime hour tracking
- **Absent**: No wage calculation
- **Half Day**: Calculated as 0.5 days
- **Leave**: Depends on company policy

### Wage Calculation Engine

Located in `reports_page_gui.py`, the calculation engine:

1. **Fetches Employee Data**: Gets daily wage rate and last payment date
2. **Calculates Present Days**: Counts attendance days since last payment
3. **Sums Overtime Hours**: Aggregates all overtime hours in the period
4. **Applies Formula**: Uses the wage calculation formula
5. **Displays Results**: Shows breakdown in color-coded cards

### Payment Cycle Management

When "Mark as Paid" is clicked:
1. Updates `last_paid` field to current timestamp
2. Resets calculation period
3. Shows success confirmation
4. Refreshes wage calculation display

## üìä Usage Instructions

### For Employees with Daily Wages

1. **Navigate** to Data Management ‚Üí Employees
2. **Add/Edit** employee with daily wage rate
3. **Set Attendance** with appropriate status
4. **Enable Overtime** field when status is "Overtime"
5. **Enter Overtime Hours** when applicable

### For Wage Calculations

1. **Navigate** to Reports ‚Üí Wage Reports tab
2. **Select Employee** from dropdown
